	  This enables support for the Philips UCB1400 touchscreen interface.
	  The UCB1400 is an AC97 audio codec.  The touchscreen interface
	  will be initialized only after the ALSA subsystem has been
	  brought up and the UCB1400 detected.  You therefore have to
	  configure ALSA support as well (either built-in or modular,
	  independently of whether this driver is itself built-in or
