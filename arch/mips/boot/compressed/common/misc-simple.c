 * Misc. bootloader code for many machines.  This assumes you have are using 
 * a 6xx/7xx/74xx CPU in your machine.  This assumes the chunk of memory 
 * below 8MB is free.  Finally, it assumes you have a NS16550-style uart for  
 * your serial console.  If a machine meets these requirements, it can quite 
 * likely use this code during boot.
